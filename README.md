selix - the JavaScript text input selection library
===================================================

`selix` is a extremely tiny and easy-to-use JavaScript library for manipulating the selection inside of user input elements. It helps you manipulate the selection inside of user inputs such as textareas and inputs and it is therefore very useful in cases such as text editors.

Installing
----------

    bower install selix

You can also manually download the file. `selix` also supports Browserify - it exports itself the node way if that is possible.
    
Documentation
-------------

Make sure to read the documentation. You need to take special precautions for Internet Explorer: http://bilde.github.io/selix/index.html

Get involved
------------

`selix` is still very young and therefore bug reports are very much encouraged. Feel free to submit pull requests. `selix` is built using gulp from the command line: just run `gulp`
